Introduction\nThe paper \"Mixed Precision Training\" is easy to read after understanding \nsome underlying computer system knowledge such as data type, so here just \nintroduce some tips and extension of the paper by summary some industrial \nimplementation.  \n2. Extension\n2.1. Loss Scaling\nAs the paper mentioned, loss scaling is really useful when putting the \"compressed\" \nparameters into the range in which lower data precision can represent them. This tech \ncould be used in two approach, one is using static loss scaling factor, other is using \ndynamic loss scaling factor. The first one is easy to understand, now focus on the \ndynamic one.  \nThe paper mentioned \"automating loss-scaling factor\" at last, the author means, for \ninstance, if some gradients or parameters happened overflow, which means these number \nis to large to represented by float16, so we should decrease loss-scaling factor, on \nthe other hand, if underflow happens, in this case we should increase loss-scaling \nfactor.  \nOpenSeq2Seq did more on \"automating loss-scaling factor\". OpenSeq2Seq implements \nan extension to the mixed precision recipe that we call automatic loss scaling. \nThe optimizer inspects the parameter gradients at each iteration and uses their \nvalues to select the loss scale for the next iteration.  Concretely, OpenSeq2Seq \nhas support for two automatic loss scaling algorithms, Backoff and LogNormal scaling.  \n2.1.1. Backoff Scaling\nBackoff scaling begins with a large loss scale and checks for overflow in the \nparameter gradients at the end of each iteration. Whenever there is an overflow, \nthe loss scale decreases by a constant factor (default is 2) and the optimizer will \nskip the update. Furthermore, if there has been no overflow for a period of time, \nthe loss scale increases by a constant factor (defaults are 2000 iterations and 2, \nrespectively). These two rules together ensure both that the loss scale is as large \nas possible and also that it can adjust to shifting dynamic range during training.  \nThis scaling method is similiar with \"dynamic fixed point\" method mentioned in \n\"Training deep neural networks with low precision multiplications\".\n2.1.2. LogNormal Scaling\nLogNormal scaling uses gradient statistics, rather than the presence of overflow, \nto set the loss scale. It keeps a running estimate of the mean and variance of \nthe inter-iteration maximum absolute value of the parameter gradients. It models \nthe inter-iteration maximum as log-normally distributed (hence the name), and then \nchooses the loss scale for the next iteration s.t. the probability of the maximum \noverflowing float16 is less than some constant (default is 0.001). In the rare \nevent of an overflow, the optimizer skips the update.\n"},"code_reading/":{"url":"code_reading/","title":"Code Reading","keywords":"","body":"Code Reading\nCode reading notes for some projects.\n"},"code_reading/tensorflow/":{"url":"code_reading/tensorflow/","title":"TensorFlow","keywords":"","body":"tensorflow code reading notes\n"},"programming_language/":{"url":"programming_language/","title":"Programming Language","keywords":"","body":""},"programming_language/cpp_tips.html":{"url":"programming_language/cpp_tips.html","title":"Cpp Tips","keywords":"","body":"Cpp Tips\n1.

Not Free Allocated Memory Case\n\nNot delete after allocate by new.\nRaise error before running delete.\n\nfor instance:\nObjectType* temp_ptr = new ObjectType();\ntemp_ptr->foo();\ndelete temp_ptr;\n\nIf not calling delete or raising error at temp_ptr->foo();, \nthe memory allocated by new will not free, which will cause \ncertain block in memory space call not be allocate by other codes.\n2.

Notions and Syntax Details\n\nStatic Variable and static \nconstRefer to https://www.cnblogs.com/Forever-Kenlen-Ja/p/3776991.html.\n\nusing const decorate function/method's arguments.Sometimes this is not necessray, since in certain cases, the \nfunctions will build arguments' copy in function body. But in \nsome other cases, such as the arguments include pointer, the \nconst before these pointer arguments can protect the value \npointed by these pointer modified by function. \nFor some self-defined type arguments, copying these arguments \nin function body is low efficiency, so we can use pointer of \nthese variables with a const decoration for protection.For instance:void StringCopy(char* strDestination, const char *strSource);\n\nUsing const decorate char *strSource can protect the value\npointed by strSource from modified by function.\nusing const decorate function/method's return(const修饰函数的返回值)\n\nusing const decorate function/method itself(const放在函数体前)For instance:\nint add(int a, int b) const {\n  return a + b;\n};\n// It error if use `a = 3;` before `return a + b;`.\n\nIn this case, in function body(函数体), we can not modify any \nvariables.\n\n\n\nconstexpr  Represents \"constant expression(常量表达式)\", which value will \n  never changed and calculated during compiling phase, \n  for instance:\n  const int i = 3; // Also a constant expression.\n  const int j = i + 1; // Also a constant expression.\n\n  int f(int a) {\n      return (a + 1);\n  }\n  // This is not constant expression, since the value of \n  // `m` can only gotten during running phase. \n  const int m = f(1); \n  // So, we can also coding as:\n  constexpr int i = 3;\n  constexpr int j = i + 1;\n\n  // we can not write `constexpr int m = f(1)` since `f` \n  // is not a \"constexpr function\".\n\n  Refer to https://www.cnblogs.com/td15980891505/p/5137013.html.\n\nconstexpr function(编译期函数)\nFor constexpr function, using constexpr before function \ndeclaration. Here we have some new notions, such as \ncompiling phase constant, etc. For instance:\n// `array_size` is a \"compiling phase constant\".\nconstexpr auto array_size = 10;\n// So the following code could be right compiled, since \n// the compiler can get the value of `array_size` during \n// compiling phase.\nstd::array data2; \n\n// The following case con not be compiled, since the compiler \n// con not get the value of value of `array_size` during \n// compiling phase so can not compile next line.\nconst auto array_size = sz; \nstd::array data;\n\nNow extending to constexpr function:\n// cpp 11\nconstexpr int factorial(int n) {\n  return n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);\n}\n// cpp 14\nconstexpr int factorial2(int n) {\n  int result = 1;\n  for (int i = 1; i \nGetting the value of expression is during compiling phase is \npretty useful. In cpp 11, there are some limitations, such as you \ncan not define declare variables in constexpr function body, \ncan not using \"for loop\",  can only has a return expression \nin function body, stc. This means we always have to use \n\"iteration function(递归函数)\" form many times.In cpp 14, many of these limitations has been droped.Refer to https://blog.csdn.net/zwvista/article/details/54429416.\n\n\n\n\n3.2. Function\n3.3. Class\n3.3.1. Syntax Details\n\nexplicitKeyword explicit can only used for decorating constructor function \nwith only one non-default argument.Refer to https://blog.csdn.net/qq_37233607/article/details/79051075.\n\n4. Code Reuse(代码重用)\n4.1. Macro(宏)\n4.1.1. Syntax Details\n\n## and #: ## used for linking arguments, # used for \nreplacement or, \"converting to string\", refer to following example:\n\n#define CONVERT(name) #name\nint main() {\n    printf(\"You and %s are friends.\\n\", CONVERT(James));\n    return 0;\n};\n// This will print \"You and James are friends.\".\n\n#define CAT(batman, robin) batman ## robin\nint main() {\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", CAT(A, BCD));\n    return 0;\n}\n// This will print \"ABCD\".\n\n\n##__VA_ARGS__ and __VA_ARGS__ and ...: __VA_ARGS__ and \n... are similiar, both means the number of macro function's \narguments is variable; ##__VA_ARGS__ will be helpful to handling \nthe case that variable arguments number is zero.
